                      <p class="lead text-justify text-info">Malappuram is situated in the mid land area of the state. As the name suggests, it is covered with small mountains of lush greenery, bonded with several freshwater streams flowing through the city. Kadalundi Puzha, a major river in Kerala is flowing around the city. Malappuram is one of the few municipalities in the state with a tremendous track record of keeping the city clean. The recognition as second 'best municipality in up keeping the cleanliness and health by state government in 2011 and Second prize for Swachhata Excellence Awards in 2019 by Government of India acknowledges these sincere efforts of the municipality. Malappuram is the biggest potential nod of the district. Unlike other district headquarters, Malappuram holds a significant position in west–east transit along with north–south. It makes the city accessible for everyone in the district through either National Highway or State Highway. The strategical location of the city is yet to be exploited in many aspects. </p>

                        <p class="card-text text-info">A cluster of scenic islands, beautiful hills and rare avian species would intrigue and entice every birdwatcher on the planet. This is exactly what the Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary has to offer its visitors. One is greeted by the Kadalundi River flowing into the Arabian Sea while migratory birds casually flit about.

                          This untouched land has over 60 species of migratory birds from across the planet that visits it during different times of the year. One can see seagulls, terns, sandpipers, sand plovers, red and greenshanks, turnstones and so on with November to April being the ideal viewing time. A small hill nearby gives you a panoramic view of the entire region. You can sit back and relax, with the odd otter peeking out at you playfully. This is indeed a paradise designed especially for bird lovers.

                       </h4>
                       <p class="card-text text-info">Another attraction of Malappuram that is often compared to the famous town of Ooty, Kodikuthimala is definitely a sight for the sore eyes. A hill station of Kerala, the place is perched on a height of about 522 m above sea level, and is the highest point in the Amminikkadan hills. 
 
                        Once the spot where the Britishers once hoisted their flag, the spot was opened for tourism only a few decades ago, with a large area of the place marked already for future development projects. There is a watch tower on the top of the hill from where tourists can get a panoramic view.

                      <h4 class="card-title text-success">Bharathapuzha River
                      </h4>
                      <p class="card-text text-info">The River of Bharata, also known as Nila, the Bharathapuzha River is a west-flowing river in the state of Kerala, and is the second longest river in the state. The river has been an integral part of life in the southern regions of Malabar. The name Nila has been given to the river to show the importance of it being more than just a river, as there are several mentions of the river in the ancient Hindu scriptures. 

                        All along the river, there are about 11 dams made to use its waters for the purpose of irrigation. Culturally, the river has an importance in a number of parts of the state, like the famous Kerala Kalamandalam which is housed on the banks of the river.
