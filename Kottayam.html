                       </h4>
                       <p class="card-text text-info">Located around 50 kms from the town of Kottayam near Ernakulam, Chottanikkara is the most revered of the 393 Hindu shrines spread across 3 districts in the state of Kerala. Popular for its spectacular architecture, the shrine stands out to be the ultimate testimonial for the primordial vishwakarma sthapathis (wooden sculpture) in carving out this temple. Sree Mahamaya Bhagawati (Aadiparashakthi), believed to be the supreme mother Goddess in Hindu religion, also known as the Goddess of Power presides the temple. Popularly known as Chottanikkara Devi, the Goddess is worshipped in three forms at three different times of the day. In the morning, she is worshipped as Maha Saraswati (Mother of Knowledge), decked in white; in the afternoon, she is worshipped as Maha Lakshmi (Mother of Wealth), clad in crimson; and in the evening, she is worshipped as Sree Durga (Mother of Power), draped in blue.

                        Besides the Chottanikkara Devi, Supreme God Shiva, Ganesha and Lord Dharmasastha (Ayyappa) are also worshipped at the temple.

                      </h4>
                      <p class="card-text text-info">This tomb holds the mortal remains of an Indian religious educator, St. Alphonsa (1910-1946), who was born as Anna Muttathupadathu. She is said to be the first Indian woman to be canonized by the Catholic Church as a saint.

                        Every year on 28th July, the church is teeming with devotees who pay homage to the sister on the death anniversary. You will also find a museum adjacent to the chapel which displays her belongings including an umbrella, cot, and books. If you are the religious kind of person then you must visit this chapel as it is one of the most revered places to visit in Kottayam.
