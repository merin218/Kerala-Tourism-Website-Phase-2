                      <p class="lead text-justify text-info">Wayanad district stands on the southern tip of the Deccan plateau and includes part of the Western Ghats. The western parts of the district bordering Kozhikode district consists of the Western Ghats covered with dense forest. The district forms a part of the south western Deccan plateau, and is sloped to the east. Quite a large area of the district is covered by forest but the continued and indiscriminate exploitation of the natural resources point towards an imminent[55] environmental crisis. There are a lot of trekking points in this district. Chembra Peak (2,100m) is the highest peak in the Wayanad district. Banasura Hill (2,079m) is also similar to height of Chembra hill.

                        The district is blessed with rich water resources. There are east flowing and west flowing rivers in the region. One of the major rivers in the district is Kabini River, a tributary of River Kaveri; it is also one of the only three east flowing rivers in Kerala. Kabani has many tributaries including Thirunelli River, Panamaram River and Mananthavady River. All these rivulets help form a rich water resource as well as a distinct landscape for the district. Various streams flow into the Panamaram rivulet while it passes through the mountain gorges and finally the river falls down into Panamaram Valley. After flowing through the district for a certain distance, River Panamaram joins Mananthavady River, which originates from the lower regions of the peak called 'Thondarmudi'.  </p>

                      </h4>
                      <p class="card-text text-info">Travel back in time to the Stone Age with a visit to Edakkal Caves that are located on the Ambukuthi Hills. Edakkal literally translates to ‘a stone in between’ and this cave and showcases a natural masterpiece. 

                        It is associated with many myths and considered as one of the most sacred places to visit in Wayanad. Edakkal caves are not actually considered to be caves in a scientific sense yet remain a great piece of archaeological curiosity for tourists. 
                        
                        These caves are identified as a Neolithic settlement and present the evidence of a pre-historic society of highly civilised people. These caves draw in a number of history buffs and students of archaeology who wish to explore these mysterious caves.
