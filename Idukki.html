                        <p class="card-text text-info">The Idukki Dam, located in Kerala, India, is a 168.91 m (554 ft) tall arch dam. The dam stands between the two mountains â€“ Kuravanmala (839)m and Kurathimala (925)m. It was constructed and is owned by the Kerala State Electricity Board. It supports a 780 MW hydroelectric power station.

                          It is built on the Periyar River, in the ravine between the Kuravan and Kurathi Hills in Kerala, India. At 167.68 metres, it is one of the highest arch dams in Asia and third tallest arch dam. It started generating power on 4 October 1975.[1] Technically, the dam type is a concrete double curvature parabolic, thin arc dam.
                          
                          This dam was constructed along with two other dams at Cheruthoni and Kulamavu.

                       </h4>
                       <p class="card-text text-info">At a distance of 39 Kms from Munnar, the magnificent Valara Waterfalls is located between Adimali and Neriamangalam on Munnar to Kochi highway (NH49), near Cheeyappara Waterfalls.

                        Valara features a chain of waterfalls falling from a height of about 1000 feet and provide a magnificent view. These waterfalls are surrounded by lush, dense forests that are home to a variety of animals and birds. It is one of the top waterfalls near Munnar.
                        
                        Though the falls are visible from highway, it demands good amount of trekking to reach the bottom of the falls. The surrounding places of the Valara Falls are good for trekking. The falls offer spectacular views in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons.
                        
                        This place is connected by buses running between Munnar and Kochi.
